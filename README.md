    <h3> By: Matthew Lopez</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Matthew Lopez, I am currently a student at Reedley community College, 
        and 21 years old. My academic goal is to further my studies about coding, 
        real estate laws, and finish with and acquire my business degree. But I also 
        wish to chase my childhood dream of receiving a division 1 scholarship to play 
        football. Making sure my college is paid for so I have no need to worry about. 
        I am currently a runningback for the Reedley college football tigers. My desired 
        position is to become a entrepreneur. Also my other desire position is to be a 
        successful football player.

        When it comes to school I have no shortness of the difference in teaching and 
        lessons from different states. Being in California I found that it is much harder 
        to get a F in a class than it was to get a C in Washington state. This is because 
        I am a military child, I have moved houses seven different times. I have changed 
        elementary schools six times, been at the same middle school, changed high schools 
        three times, and finally moved colleges so far twice.

        When It comes to work I have done just about everything you can do. Besides 
        fast food, I have worked in the fields doing berry picking, weeding, and 
        other things such as this. I have babysat multiple different of kids. I have 
        done lawn services mowing lawns, picking weeds, raking. Finally my first real 
        job being Best Buy electronics I worked as what is called product flow I moved 
        fridges, coolers, TVs, and picked online orders. Then moved to Big 5 sporting 
        goods where I unloaded trucks, helped out customers with their needs. Finally 
        to what I do now catering, I serve food and treat customers properly to try 
        and get tips.
